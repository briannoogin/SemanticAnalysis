Funny cat photos, trending news stories, and the best discussions on the internet—these are just a few of the awesome things the official Reddit app does best.
On Reddit, there’s a community for every subject imaginable: your favorite sports team, relationship advice, memes, the latest in news and politics—all in real time.

And if you like gifs (or jifs, jiffys, glyphs, ifs, however you choose to mispronounce it), we’re positive you'll love it.

What’s that you say, girl? “What about a community dedicated solely to images of cats standing on their hind legs?”

We got that, too.

Whether you’re into movies or space travel, baking or weight training, cheesy dad jokes or more NSFW humor, world news or Hollywood gossip—or all of the above—you can instantly share your content and ideas with an audience of millions.

We’re not saying Reddit is like all your favorite apps put together. But if we were saying that, we’d tell you it has:

 the trendy headlines of Twitter
 the educational content of Quora
 the viral pics of Memebase and Imgur
 the jokesters of Tumblr
 the lols of 9GAG and theCHIVE
 the cringeworthy personal stories of FML and Fail Blog
 the rage comics of fourchan
 and the powerful, human stories found only on Reddit.

(Oops, we went full circle.)

So the next time you’re bored and need a break—wait, you’re bored right now? Why are you still reading this? Download the app already!

Those cats won’t stand on their hind legs forever...
